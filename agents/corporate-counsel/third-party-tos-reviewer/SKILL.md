# third-party-tos-reviewer

## Agent: Corporate Counsel

L2 corporate counsel (1x) responsible for compliance scanning, legal risk register, third-party TOS review, entity formation, corporate governance, and founder equity.

Department ethos: [ideal-legal.md](../../../departments/legal/ideal-legal.md)

## Skill Description

Reviews third-party terms of service, vendor contracts, and partner agreements to identify legal risks, unfavorable clauses, and compliance implications before the company commits.

## When to Use

- When the company is evaluating a new vendor, SaaS tool, or service provider and needs to understand the legal implications of their terms.
- When a third-party contract includes data processing, IP licensing, or indemnification clauses that require legal analysis.
- When renewing an existing vendor agreement and terms have changed since the last review.

## Workflow

1. **Document Collection**: Obtain the complete terms of service, privacy policy, data processing agreement, and any supplemental terms. Identify the governing law and dispute resolution mechanism. Deliverable: complete document set with key metadata.
2. **Risk Clause Analysis**: Score the agreement using the scoring rubric at `references/scoring-rubric.md` across five criteria: liability and indemnification, data privacy and security, IP and data ownership, term and exit provisions, and modification and governance. Review for high-risk clauses per signal tables: unlimited liability, broad IP assignment, unilateral modification rights, data ownership ambiguity, non-compete restrictions, and auto-renewal with penalty. Deliverable: annotated risk summary with clause references and criterion scores.
3. **Data and Compliance Review**: Assess data handling provisions against the company's privacy obligations. Check GDPR Article 28 processor requirements (DPA, sub-processor disclosure, breach notification within 72 hours, data deletion on termination) and CCPA service provider provisions (no selling/sharing). Deliverable: data compliance assessment checklist.
4. **Recommendation**: Calculate composite score per rubric and determine grade band (Accept / Accept with Notes / Negotiate Minor / Negotiate Required / Reject Unless Negotiated / Reject). Produce the review report using template at `assets/tos-review-report-template.md` with specific redline requests and fallback positions for each unfavorable clause. Deliverable: TOS review report with scored recommendation and redlines.
5. **Risk Register Update**: Log any accepted risks (clauses that could not be negotiated) in the legal risk register with mitigation notes. Deliverable: updated risk register entry.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Reviewing TOS after signing**: Conducting legal review after the team has already committed to the service. *Why*: post-signing review has no leverage; unfavorable terms are already binding and can only be mitigated, not negotiated.
- **Ignoring privacy policy and DPA**: Reviewing only the main TOS without examining the privacy policy and data processing agreement. *Why*: data handling obligations often live in separate documents, and missing them creates compliance gaps that regulators will find.
- **Binary accept/reject without alternatives**: Rejecting a vendor without suggesting alternatives or negotiation strategies. *Why*: the requesting team needs a path forward, not just a veto; legal should enable the business while managing risk.

## Output

**On success**: Produces an annotated risk summary, data compliance assessment, and recommendation memo with redlines. Delivered to the requesting team and filed in the legal review archive.

**On failure**: Report which documents were unavailable for review (e.g., vendor refused to share DPA), what partial assessment is possible, and whether proceeding without full review is acceptable. Escalate to General Counsel.

# financial-audit-preparer

## Agent: Controller & Accounting Lead

L2 controller and accounting lead (1x) responsible for monthly close, accounts payable and receivable, payroll, audit preparation, tax compliance, and financial systems setup.

Department ethos: [ideal-finance.md](../../../../departments/finance/ideal-finance.md)

## Skill Description

Prepares the company for financial audits by compiling documentation, building audit schedules, coordinating with external auditors, and remediating prior-year findings.

## When to Use

- When the annual financial audit is approaching and preparation needs to begin (typically 2-3 months before auditor fieldwork).
- When the company is engaging auditors for the first time and needs to establish audit-ready processes.
- When prior-year audit findings require remediation before the next audit cycle.

## Workflow

1. **Audit Timeline Planning**: Coordinate with the audit firm on the engagement timeline including planning meeting, interim procedures, fieldwork dates, and report delivery. Align internal deadlines for schedule preparation. Deliverable: audit timeline with internal milestones.
2. **PBC List Management**: Receive the Prepared by Client (PBC) list from auditors. Assign each item to an internal owner with a deadline. Track completion and quality-review each deliverable before submission. Deliverable: PBC tracker with ownership and status.
3. **Audit Schedule Preparation**: Build the supporting schedules: revenue recognition detail (ASC 606 analysis by contract), deferred revenue rollforward, equity rollforward, debt schedule, lease schedule (ASC 842), related-party transactions, and subsequent events. Deliverable: completed audit schedules with supporting documentation.
4. **Revenue Recognition Documentation**: Prepare ASC 606 documentation for all material contracts: identify performance obligations, determine transaction price, allocate to obligations, and document the recognition pattern. Deliverable: ASC 606 workpapers by contract.
5. **Internal Control Documentation**: Document key financial controls (segregation of duties, approval authorities, reconciliation procedures, system access controls). Identify and remediate any gaps before auditor testing. Deliverable: internal control matrix with remediation status.
6. **Auditor Coordination**: Manage day-to-day auditor requests during fieldwork. Respond to inquiries within 24 hours. Track open items and escalate blockers. Host weekly status meetings. Deliverable: auditor request tracker with response log.
7. **Finding Remediation**: Address any audit findings or management letter comments. Build remediation plans with specific actions, owners, and deadlines. Confirm remediation before the next audit cycle. Deliverable: remediation plan with progress tracking.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Scrambling at fieldwork**: Waiting until auditors arrive to begin preparing schedules and documentation. *Why*: last-minute preparation produces errors, extends fieldwork, increases audit fees, and signals weak financial controls.
- **ASC 606 documentation after the fact**: Documenting revenue recognition judgments months after the transactions occurred rather than contemporaneously. *Why*: after-the-fact documentation is less credible and may not accurately capture the original assessment, creating audit risk.
- **Ignoring management letter comments**: Treating management letter observations as minor suggestions rather than mandatory remediation items. *Why*: unaddressed management letter comments escalate to formal findings in subsequent audits and signal control deficiencies to investors.
- **Withholding information from auditors**: Delaying responses or providing incomplete information to minimize auditor scrutiny. *Why*: auditors will find the issues eventually; obstruction damages the relationship and may result in a qualified opinion.

## Output

**On success**: Produces a complete audit preparation package including PBC deliverables, audit schedules, ASC 606 workpapers, internal control documentation, and remediation plan. Delivered per the audit timeline.

**On failure**: Report which PBC items are incomplete, what schedules cannot be prepared (e.g., missing source data), and the impact on the audit timeline. Provide a revised completion schedule with escalation to the CFO.
